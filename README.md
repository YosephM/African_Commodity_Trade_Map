# African_Commodity_Trade_Map
This is a project I  did for UNECA, to show How African is doing while treading its major commodities and showing the trade balance between selling row commodities and processed products.
It also looks to help Afican countries dicover new treading partners and encourage them to trade among neighbours to save on logistics.
